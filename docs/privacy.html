<h1>Privacy Policy - Indiana</h1>
<p>
    This application stores the provided API token locally on your phone to deliver its service. It
    will only be used to communicate with the service provider that issued the token and not shared
    with any third parties.
</p>
<p>
    To enhance the user experience of this app, we use the following optional tracking services with
    Google Firebase:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous usage data to understand how you use the
        app and improve your experience. This includes screen views, button clicks, and feature
        usage patterns.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Crash Reporting (Crashlytics):</strong> We automatically collect crash reports to
        help us identify and fix bugs faster. This includes stack traces and device information when
        the app crashes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> We monitor app performance metrics like startup
        time, screen rendering, and network requests to identify and fix slowdowns.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This tracking data is collected by
    Google Firebase and is subject to Google's privacy practices. While we do not collect
    personally identifiable information directly, Firebase may collect device identifiers and other
    data that could potentially be used to track usage patterns. You can control these settings and
    disable any or all of these services at any time through the app's tracking settings.
</p>
<p>
    To install APKs on the phone this app requires the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission.
</p>
<p>
    This policy may change with any future update and all the changes will be reflected here.
